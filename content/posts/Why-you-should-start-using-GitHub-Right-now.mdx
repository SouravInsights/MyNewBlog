Before you start reading this article, let me tell you “**Why**” you should
learn about **GitHub** and **Why** you should waste your valuable time
reading this blog?

#### Why learn GitHub?

**Do you know** that many recruiters or interviewers ask for **GitHub**
profiles? A good **GitHub** profile can impress the interviewer. But the sad
part is only few candidates have a GitHub page on their resumes and most of them
are not well maintained. So you definitely get better chance to stand out by
keeping an up-to-date GitHub profile. Check out this blog “[How to Make GitHub
as Your New
Resume](http://blog.gainlo.co/index.php/2015/11/13/how-to-make-github-as-your-new-resume/)”.

**GitHub** is undoubtedly a valuable skill to have as a programmer, not only in
the workplace, but also personally. It’s the most popular source code hosting
facility out there, and it’s still growing. Millions of developers use GitHub to
share code and build businesses. In 2017, the GitHub community reached 24
million developers working across 67 million repositories.

I think this much data is enough to get started with GitHub. In this article,
I’ll try to cover the good parts of **GitHub** and how to get started. But
before that let me just tell about something. According to [Josh
Schwartz](https://medium.com/u/7454cf76848d), a data Scientist, it has been
proved that readers can’t stay focused. The more I type, the more you tune out.
And it happens with everyone. When readers start reading an article, they very
rarely make it all the way down the page. A lot of people don’t even make it
halfway. I know that you’re not going to stick around for long. So let’s talk
about some **REWARDS** that you get on completion of each section of this
article.

#### Here’s what you get.

1.  A free **.me** domain and **SSL** certificate for 1 year.
1.  **PluralSight Premium Membership **free for 3 months.

And many more…

### Let’s get started..

> Are you a student interested about technology? Are you a Freshman who is new to Programming? Are you interested about developing websites? Are you making any computer science project and looking for free project management platform? If any of these questions satisfies for you then this article is worth reading.

### 1. Introduction to GitHub

**GitHub** is a repository hosting service. Think of it as the "cloud" for code.
This can be a simple definition of **GitHub**. Now let me give you a scenario
which can better explain the above definition. Let’s say you are a Computer
Science Student and you started making your portfolio website. Now in the
process of making it you get stuck at a point and you want your friend to help
you with the code. But the sad part is he’s living at a distance. Now you’re
completely stuck. This is where **GitHub** can actually help you solving this
problem by saving it in the cloud, which simply means both you and your friend
will be having a copy on both of your PCs.

Now let’s consider another scenario where you and your team is working on a
software project. Let’s say you have found some issues with the software and
you’ve changed the code; now at this point your team members wouldn’t know the
changes you have made and vice versa.

This is where the **GitHub** magic comes.

1. GitHub lets you save your code online.
2. GitHub will allow all the developers of a project to see what changes the other one has made.
3. It allows you to discuss issues in your code with other developers.

**GitHub** is like a portfolio for programmers. Companies love programmers that
invest themselves in the community. In fact, learning how to use it can give you
a really good job. Increasingly companies are asking to see a **GitHub**
account, followed by references. **GitHub** is your new resume, build it wisely.

As I have mentioned above that you’ll be getting some REWARDS after completion
of each section of this blog, here is your first reward.

#### Reward:

- **.ME **domain **free** for 1 year

> Instructions: Open any web browser and type **GitHub Student Pack** or simply click this [link](https://education.github.com/pack)**.** Use your university mail ID to be able to use this benefit. Then search for **Namecheap** from the list and follow the instructions to get a free .**ME **domain free for 1 year. If you’re facing any problem you can follow this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q4_r1jLh2U).

Prerequisite: A **GitHub** account. Yes, I know that all of you know this.

- It’s not yet over. By signing up for GitHub Student Pack, you can also get
  access to all these cool stuffs.

1.  **AWS Educate:** Access to the AWS cloud, free training, and collaboration
    resources
1.  **DigitalOcean: **Simple cloud hosting, built for developers. Worth \$50 in
    platform credit for new users.
1.  **GitHub:** Unlimited private repositories (normally \$7/month) while you are a
    student.
1.  **Microsoft Azure:** Free access to 25+ Microsoft Azure cloud services plus \$100
    in Azure credit.
1.  And there are many more...

### Words People Use When They Talk About GitHub

In this article, there are a few words I’m going to use repeatedly. Here’s the
big ones:

**Repository**: You can think of it as a folder or storage space where your
project files can be stored. Sometimes **GitHub** users shorten this to “repo.”
You can keep code files (like : HTML, CSS, JS etc.), text files, image files,
inside a repository.

**Fork: **Fork can also be termed as copy or clone. Let’s consider the previous
example where you were building a website for which you needed some help from
your friend. Now your friend have found out some issues and wants to change
something on your project. But here, he can not directly make any changes to the
main file so he’ll make a copy of it. This is what forking means.

**Pull Request:** In simplest form, pull requests are a way by which developers
notify their team members that they have completed a feature and asking your
permission to add your changes to the main file. For example, you have made some
changes to your project now you want your teammates to review your changes. If
there are any problems with the changes, teammates can post feedback in the pull
request.

**Version Control**: Basically, the purpose Git was designed to serve. When you
have a Microsoft Word file, you either overwrite every saved file with a new
save, or you save multiple versions. With Git, you don’t have to. It keeps
“snapshots” of every point in time in the project’s history, so you can never
lose or overwrite it.

### I hope this has helped to get a good understanding about GitHub and it’s

benefits, but if not, please leave a comment below.

What’s next? Well I’ll publish another blog where I’ll tell you how I use
**GitHub** for all of my Projects. I’ll also show you some demos of **cool
features of GitHub.**
