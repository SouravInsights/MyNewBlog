### Important takeaways from Hacktoberfest:

#### 1. What is Open Source?

Open Source Software is a computer software whose source code is made publicly
available for modification and enhancements. It is released under various
licenses like BSD, MIT etc. Read this article about ‚Äú[What is open
source?](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)‚Äù

#### 2. Recap of what we did in Git & GitHub workshop:

While we made sure that every attendees must have a Git cheat sheet but still
I‚Äôd like to briefly mention the things we did in the event.

1.  [Create a new
    repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository) on**
    GitHub**. To avoid errors, do not initialize the new repository with _README_,
    license, or `gitignore` files. You can add these files after your project has
    been pushed to GitHub.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*ar_F2dl_dYZWINwv0--Gjw.png)

2.  Go to your project directory and CD into it.

3.  Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.

    \$ git init

4.  Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first
    commit.

        $ git add .

5.  Commit the files that you‚Äôve staged in your local repository.

        $ git commit -m ‚ÄúFirst commit
        # Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository.

6.  At the top of your GitHub repository‚Äôs Quick Setup page, click to copy the
    remote repository URL.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*yIySDbV7M20ZxLQ0.png)

7.  In the Command prompt, [add the URL for the remote
    repository](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-remote) where your local
    repository will be pushed.

        $ git remote add origin
        # Sets the new remote

8.  [Push the changes](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote) in
    your local repository to **GitHub**.

        $ git push origin master
        # Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin

#### 3. Hacktoberfest Outline: ( What participants did? )

We had prepared a [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/Emisha-GITA/Demo-Portfolio-Website) called `Demo Portfolio Website` with some beginner level issues where around 92 pull requests
got generated by the participants.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*lWNemMGnDmxSoRdapsBxKg.png)

But this contribution didn‚Äôt mean much in the open source world. They needed to
know about the real issues from open source projects that matter. So we talked
more about how to find issues in GitHub, how *labels *help, how we can filter
issues by labels or languages. ( Check out this [website](http://issuehub.io/)
to easily search issue labels to find the right project for you. )
